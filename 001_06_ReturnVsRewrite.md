In NGINX, both the `return` and `rewrite` directives are used to manipulate how requests are handled, but they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases:

### 1. `return` Directive:

The `return` directive is primarily used to control the response returned to the client. It allows you to set the HTTP status code and provide an optional response body. Here are the key differences and use cases for the `return` directive:

- **Response Control**: `return` is used when you want to control the response sent back to the client, including the HTTP status code and the response body.

- **HTTP Status Code**: You can specify the HTTP status code explicitly, such as `return 200;` for a successful response or `return 404;` for a Not Found error.

- **Response Body**: You can include an optional response body as a string within double quotes. For example, `return 200 "OK";` will return a response with a 200 status code and "OK" in the body.

- **No URL Rewriting**: `return` does not change the requested URL. It sends the response with the specified status code and body without altering the URL.

```nginx
location /old-path {
    return 301 /new-path;
}
```
In this example:

When a request is made to /old-path, Nginx returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) and redirects the client to /new-path.

You can also return custom response codes and messages. For instance, to return a "Not Found" response:

```nginx
location /missing-page {
    return 404 "The requested page was not found";
}
```

### 2. `rewrite` Directive:

The `rewrite` directive, on the other hand, is used to change the URL of the request by performing URL rewriting. Here are the key differences and use cases for the `rewrite` directive:

- **URL Rewriting**: `rewrite` is used when you want to change the URL of the incoming request. It allows you to modify the request URI based on regular expressions.

- **URL Transformation**: You can use `rewrite` to modify the request URL before processing the request, such as changing a URL path or adding query parameters.

- **Location Change**: When you use `rewrite`, NGINX will re-evaluate the location block for the modified URL, potentially affecting how the request is processed further.

- **No Direct Response Control**: `rewrite` itself does not control the response sent to the client. It's mainly used for modifying the request URL.

```nginx
location /old-path {
    rewrite ^/old-path/(.*)$ /new-path/$1 last;
}
```
In this example:

When a request is made to /old-path/some-page, the rewrite directive captures the part after /old-path/ (in this case, some-page) using a regular expression and appends it to /new-path/. So, the request is internally rewritten to /new-path/some-page.

The last flag indicates that Nginx should apply the rewritten URI to the current location block.

In summary, `return` is primarily for controlling the HTTP response that is sent to the client, including setting status codes and response bodies. `rewrite`, on the other hand, is for changing the URL of the incoming request, which can affect how NGINX processes the request but doesn't directly control the response sent to the client. You can use these directives separately or in combination to achieve various behavior modifications in your NGINX configuration.

To summarize:

* Use return for simple HTTP status codes, redirections, and sending response bodies.
* Use rewrite for more complex URL manipulations, including pattern-based rewriting and route adjustments.
