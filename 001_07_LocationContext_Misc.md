## try_files

The `try_files` is used to specify a series of files or URIs that Nginx should attempt to serve when a client requests a particular resource. It's often used for implementing fallbacks or error handling in web server configurations.

Here's the basic syntax of the `try_files` directive in Nginx:

```nginx
location /some/path/ {
    try_files file1 file2 ... fileN;
}
```

In this configuration:

- `/some/path/` is the location block where the `try_files` directive is applied.

- `file1`, `file2`, ..., `fileN` are the files or URIs that Nginx will attempt to serve in the order specified. If the first file or URI doesn't exist or returns an error, Nginx will try the next one, and so on, until it either serves a valid response or exhausts the list.

Here's an example that demonstrates how `try_files` can be used in a simple Nginx configuration:

```nginx
location /images/ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /images/default.jpg;
}
```

In this example:

- If a request is made for a file in the `/images/` directory (e.g., `/images/pic.jpg`), Nginx will try to serve the requested file. If it exists, it will be served.

- If the request is for a directory (e.g., `/images/`), Nginx will try to serve the default index file for directories (typically `index.html` or `index.php`) if it exists.

- If none of the above conditions are met (e.g., the requested file or directory doesn't exist), Nginx will serve the `/images/default.jpg` file as a fallback.

The `try_files` directive is commonly used for handling various scenarios, such as serving default pages, implementing clean URLs, or handling error pages. It's a powerful feature for controlling how Nginx responds to different client requests.
