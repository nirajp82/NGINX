### Explanation of `proxy_ssl_name $host;`

In NGINX, when you configure it as a reverse proxy to forward requests to an HTTPS backend server, it may need to communicate with that backend server over SSL/TLS. The `proxy_ssl_name` directive allows you to specify the **hostname** that NGINX should use when establishing the SSL/TLS connection with the backend server.

- **`proxy_ssl_name`**: This directive is used to set the **hostname** NGINX uses when performing the SSL handshake with the upstream (backend) server. It is especially useful when you're using SSL/TLS with the backend and need to ensure that the correct certificate is used during the handshake, based on the hostname of the request.

- **`$host`**: This is a built-in NGINX variable that represents the **hostname** (or domain name) from the incoming request's `Host` header. In an HTTP request, the `Host` header typically contains the domain name the client is trying to reach (e.g., `www.example.com`). The `$host` variable captures this value.

So, when you use:

```nginx
proxy_ssl_name $host;
```

it tells NGINX to take the **hostname** from the client's request (the value of the `Host` header) and use that as the `Server Name` for the SSL handshake with the backend server.

### Why is This Important?

This is important for the following reasons:

1. **SNI (Server Name Indication)**: The `$host` variable allows NGINX to pass the correct hostname to the backend server during the SSL/TLS handshake, which is crucial for **SNI** (Server Name Indication). SNI is an SSL/TLS extension that allows multiple SSL certificates to be hosted on the same IP address. When the backend server hosts multiple SSL certificates, the server needs to know which certificate to present based on the requested hostname. By using `$host`, you ensure that the correct certificate is selected by the backend server.

2. **Multiple Hostnames/Virtual Hosts**: If your backend server hosts multiple virtual hosts and each virtual host has its own SSL certificate, setting `proxy_ssl_name $host;` ensures that the backend server uses the correct certificate for the requested hostname.

3. **Backend SSL Configuration**: In some cases, the backend server may perform certificate validation based on the hostname in the SNI field. If the hostname in the SNI doesn't match the expected hostname for that backend, the server may reject the connection. By forwarding the original `Host` header value (`$host`), you ensure that the SSL/TLS connection with the backend is properly established.

Certainly! Let's explore how you can dynamically set the `proxy_pass` URL **on the fly** based on certain conditions (such as domain-based routing or other variables) and still use the `proxy_ssl_name` directive to ensure that the correct **SNI** (Server Name Indication) is forwarded to the backend server.

This will involve using **NGINX with Lua** to dynamically set the `proxy_pass` value while maintaining the correct SNI configuration using `proxy_ssl_name`. Lua in NGINX can be used to implement logic that conditionally sets which backend server a request should be forwarded to. The `proxy_ssl_name` directive can still be used to pass the **hostname** as the SNI value to ensure the correct SSL/TLS certificate is used by the backend server.

### NGINX Configuration with Lua Example

```nginx
http {
    lua_shared_dict backend_cache 10m;

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name www.example1.com www.example2.com;

        location / {
            # Dynamically set the proxy_pass based on the host or other condition
            set $backend_url "";

            # Use Lua to dynamically select the backend server
            content_by_lua_block {
                local host = ngx.var.host
                -- Conditional logic based on host or other factors
                if host == "www.example1.com" then
                    ngx.var.backend_url = "https://backend1.example.com"
                elseif host == "www.example2.com" then
                    ngx.var.backend_url = "https://backend2.example.com"
                else
                    ngx.var.backend_url = "https://default-backend.example.com"
                end
            }

            # Proxy request to the dynamically chosen backend server
            proxy_pass $backend_url;

            # Use the Host header for the SNI during the SSL handshake
            proxy_ssl_name $host;   # Ensure the correct SSL certificate is selected based on the domain
        }
    }
}
```

### **Detailed Explanation**

This configuration demonstrates how you can conditionally select which backend server to proxy the request to based on the `Host` header (or any other variable). At the same time, it ensures that the correct **SNI** is used when making the SSL/TLS connection to the backend server. 

Let’s break it down in detail:

---

### **1. Lua Configuration Block (`content_by_lua_block`)**

```nginx
content_by_lua_block {
    local host = ngx.var.host
    -- Conditional logic based on host or other factors
    if host == "www.example1.com" then
        ngx.var.backend_url = "https://backend1.example.com"
    elseif host == "www.example2.com" then
        ngx.var.backend_url = "https://backend2.example.com"
    else
        ngx.var.backend_url = "https://default-backend.example.com"
    end
}
```

- **Lua Scripting**: This block uses **Lua** to define custom logic that runs when a request is received. The Lua code checks the value of the `$host` variable (which contains the hostname in the HTTP request's `Host` header).
- **Conditionally Set `proxy_pass`**: Based on the hostname (or any other custom condition), we set the `$backend_url` variable dynamically. This can be as complex as needed — for example, based on specific request headers, geographical location of the client, or other logic you might want to implement.
  
  - If the request is for `www.example1.com`, it forwards to `https://backend1.example.com`.
  - If the request is for `www.example2.com`, it forwards to `https://backend2.example.com`.
  - If the host does not match any of the conditions, it defaults to `https://default-backend.example.com`.

---

### **2. `proxy_pass` Directive**

```nginx
proxy_pass $backend_url;
```

- **Dynamically Set `proxy_pass`**: The `$backend_url` variable, which is set dynamically by the Lua block, is passed to the `proxy_pass` directive. This means that NGINX will forward the request to the backend server defined in the Lua logic.
- The URL can change based on the condition set in the Lua block. This provides a flexible way to route requests dynamically to different backend servers based on the request details.

---

### **3. Using `proxy_ssl_name` to Pass the SNI Value**

```nginx
proxy_ssl_name $host;   # Ensure the correct SSL certificate is selected based on the domain
```

- **Passing the Host as SNI**: The `proxy_ssl_name` directive is crucial when making an SSL/TLS connection to the backend server. The value of `$host` is passed as the **SNI** to the backend server. This allows the backend to choose the appropriate SSL certificate for the domain requested by the client.
- Even though the backend server (`backend1.example.com`, `backend2.example.com`, etc.) may host multiple domains, using `proxy_ssl_name $host;` ensures that the **correct certificate** is presented to the client during the handshake.
- The SNI mechanism is vital when multiple SSL certificates are hosted on the same IP, as it tells the backend server which domain to use for the SSL handshake and which certificate to present.

---

### **How It Works Together:**

1. **Incoming Request**:
   - A client makes a request to `https://www.example1.com`.

2. **NGINX Receives the Request**:
   - NGINX matches the request to the `server_name` directive (`www.example1.com` or `www.example2.com`).
   - The `content_by_lua_block` is executed, and it sets the `$backend_url` variable dynamically.
     - For `www.example1.com`, the Lua script sets `$backend_url` to `https://backend1.example.com`.

3. **Dynamic `proxy_pass`**:
   - The `proxy_pass` directive then forwards the request to the backend URL stored in `$backend_url`, i.e., `https://backend1.example.com`.
  
4. **SNI Handling**:
   - The `proxy_ssl_name` directive uses the `$host` variable, which will be `www.example1.com` in this case, to pass the correct **SNI value** to `backend1.example.com` during the SSL handshake.
   - This ensures that even though multiple domains might be hosted on the same backend server (using SNI), the correct SSL certificate for `www.example1.com` will be selected and presented.

5. **SSL/TLS Handshake**:
   - The backend server (`backend1.example.com`) receives the connection request and identifies the correct SSL certificate to use based on the SNI (`www.example1.com`).
  
6. **Response**:
   - The backend server processes the request, and the response is sent back through NGINX to the client.

---

### **Practical Use Cases**

This configuration is highly useful in scenarios where:

1. **Multiple Domains with Different Backends**: 
   - If you have multiple domains hosted on different backend servers but want to forward requests based on the domain name dynamically, this setup allows you to handle such routing efficiently.
   
2. **Complex Routing Logic**:
   - You may want to route traffic not just based on the domain name but based on custom conditions, such as headers, cookies, or even the request's geographical origin. Lua can handle complex logic for routing the traffic to different backends.

3. **Multiple SSL Certificates for the Same Backend**:
   - If you’re using **SNI** on your backend servers (i.e., multiple SSL certificates on the same IP), this configuration ensures that the backend server uses the correct SSL certificate based on the domain requested by the client, even though the backend could be serving multiple domains.
   
---

### **Conclusion**

This configuration shows how to combine **Lua scripting** in NGINX with **SNI** to dynamically set the `proxy_pass` directive and ensure the correct **SSL certificate** is used based on the requested domain. By setting the backend server dynamically using Lua (`$backend_url`), and ensuring that `proxy_ssl_name $host;` is used, NGINX can forward traffic securely to the appropriate backend with the correct SNI for SSL/TLS certificate selection.


Great question! Both `proxy_ssl_name $host` and `proxy_set_header Host $host` deal with the **Host** header in HTTP requests, but they serve very different purposes in the context of NGINX reverse proxying and SSL/TLS communication.


### **1. `proxy_ssl_name $host`**
**Purpose**: Sets the **SNI** (Server Name Indication) when NGINX communicates with the upstream (backend) server over **HTTPS**.

- **SNI** is an extension to the SSL/TLS protocol that allows clients to indicate which hostname they are trying to connect to during the SSL handshake. This is important when multiple domains are served on the same IP address using different SSL/TLS certificates.
  
- When you use `proxy_ssl_name $host`, NGINX is forwarding the value of the `$host` variable (which corresponds to the domain requested by the client in the `Host` header) as the **SNI** to the backend server during the SSL handshake. This allows the backend server to select the appropriate SSL certificate for that domain.

**Key points about `proxy_ssl_name`**:
- It affects the **SSL/TLS handshake** with the upstream server.
- It ensures the correct SSL/TLS certificate is selected for a domain when multiple certificates are hosted on the same server or IP (using SNI).
- It is used **only during SSL connections** between NGINX and the backend server (i.e., when `proxy_pass` is used with `https://`).

**Example**:
```nginx
proxy_ssl_name $host;
```
If a client connects to `https://www.example.com`, the `$host` variable will be `www.example.com`, and `proxy_ssl_name` ensures that NGINX forwards `www.example.com` as the SNI value to the backend server, so the backend knows which certificate to present.

---

### **2. `proxy_set_header Host $host`**
**Purpose**: Sets the **Host** header in the HTTP request that is forwarded to the upstream (backend) server.

- When NGINX acts as a reverse proxy, it forwards the original HTTP request to the backend server. The `Host` header in the HTTP request tells the backend which domain the client is requesting.
  
- `proxy_set_header Host $host` ensures that the **Host** header in the proxied request is set to the value of the `$host` variable (which is derived from the client request's `Host` header). This is important when the backend server needs to know the original hostname for things like routing, logging, or generating the correct URLs.

**Key points about `proxy_set_header`**:
- It affects the **HTTP headers** sent to the backend server.
- It tells the backend server which domain the client intended to contact, allowing the backend to properly handle routing or other domain-specific logic.
- It is typically used when the backend server needs to serve different content based on the `Host` header (such as different virtual hosts on the same server).

**Example**:
```nginx
proxy_set_header Host $host;
```
When a client connects to `https://www.example.com`, the `Host` header in the HTTP request will be `www.example.com`. By using `proxy_set_header Host $host;`, NGINX ensures that this header is passed along to the backend server, so it knows which domain the client was trying to access.

---

### **When to Use Each Directive?**

- **Use `proxy_ssl_name $host`** when:
  - You are proxying to a backend that uses **SNI** to differentiate between multiple SSL certificates for different domains on the same IP address.
  - You need to ensure that the correct SSL/TLS certificate is used for a specific domain when NGINX is proxying an HTTPS request to the backend.
  
- **Use `proxy_set_header Host $host`** when:
  - You want to preserve the original `Host` header in the proxied request so the backend can know which domain the client intended to contact. This is useful for routing, virtual hosting, or logging.
  - Your backend is configured to serve different content based on the `Host` header (e.g., different sites or applications running on the same server).

### **Example Use Case Scenario**

Imagine you have an NGINX reverse proxy setup where multiple domains are hosted on the same backend server, and that server uses **SNI** to differentiate SSL certificates for each domain. Here's how both directives might work together:

1. A client sends a request to `https://www.example.com`.
   
2. **`proxy_ssl_name $host;`**:
   - NGINX uses `$host` (which is `www.example.com`) to set the **SNI** during the SSL handshake with the backend server. This ensures the backend server presents the correct SSL certificate for `www.example.com`.
   
3. **`proxy_set_header Host $host;`**:
   - The `Host` header in the proxied HTTP request is set to `www.example.com`, so the backend server knows that the request is for `www.example.com`, even if multiple domains are served by the same backend.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **`proxy_ssl_name $host`** is used during the **SSL handshake** to ensure that the correct **SNI** is sent to the backend server, enabling the server to select the correct SSL certificate.
  
- **`proxy_set_header Host $host`** is used to preserve the **Host header** in the proxied HTTP request, ensuring that the backend knows which domain the client intended to access.

They are related to the **Host** header but serve different purposes — one for SSL/TLS negotiation (SNI) and the other for passing the original HTTP header to the backend.


When both `proxy_ssl_name $host;` and `proxy_set_header Host $host;` are set in the same NGINX configuration, they work together but perform distinct roles during the reverse proxying process. Here's how they will interact:

### 1. **`proxy_ssl_name $host;`** – Setting the SNI for SSL/TLS Handshake
- **Purpose**: This directive sets the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** field for the SSL/TLS handshake between NGINX and the upstream backend server when using HTTPS. The `$host` variable contains the hostname the client is trying to reach (i.e., the domain specified in the `Host` header of the client's request).
- **Function**: NGINX uses this value to indicate to the backend server which domain name it should use when selecting an SSL certificate during the TLS handshake.
  
#### **How It Works**:
- When a client makes an HTTPS request, say to `https://www.example1.com`, the `$host` variable holds the value `www.example1.com`.
- NGINX, when forwarding the request to the backend server (using `proxy_pass https://backend.example.com`), uses the `$host` value as the **SNI** in the SSL/TLS handshake to ensure the backend server selects the correct SSL certificate for `www.example1.com` (if multiple SSL certificates exist for different domains hosted on the same backend server).
  
### 2. **`proxy_set_header Host $host;`** – Passing the Host Header to the Backend
- **Purpose**: This directive modifies the **HTTP request header** sent to the upstream server by setting the `Host` header to the value of `$host`.
- **Function**: It ensures that the backend server receives the original `Host` header value from the client request, allowing the backend server to know which domain the client is requesting. This is particularly useful if the backend has different routing logic or virtual hosts configured based on the `Host` header.
  
#### **How It Works**:
- In the same scenario, when a client makes an HTTPS request to `https://www.example1.com`, the original HTTP request will contain a `Host: www.example1.com` header.
- NGINX passes this header to the backend server as is, using the `proxy_set_header Host $host;` directive. This tells the backend server that the client is requesting `www.example1.com`.

### **How They Work Together**

When both of these directives are used together, here’s how the reverse proxy flow will work:

#### **1. Client Makes a Request:**
- A client sends an HTTPS request to `https://www.example1.com`.

#### **2. NGINX Receives the Request:**
- NGINX receives the request and matches it to a server block based on the domain (`www.example1.com` in this case).
- NGINX is configured to forward the request to an upstream server, say `backend.example.com`.

#### **3. SSL/TLS Handshake with Backend:**
- Before sending the HTTP request to the backend, NGINX needs to establish an SSL/TLS connection with the backend server.
- **`proxy_ssl_name $host;`** ensures that during the SSL/TLS handshake between NGINX and `backend.example.com`, the **SNI** value (`www.example1.com`) is sent to the backend.
- The backend server will then select the correct SSL certificate for `www.example1.com` (if multiple certificates are configured for different domains).

#### **4. Passing the HTTP Request to the Backend:**
- After the SSL/TLS handshake is completed, NGINX forwards the original HTTP request to the backend server. 
- **`proxy_set_header Host $host;`** ensures that the backend server sees the `Host` header as `www.example1.com` (which is the same as what the client originally requested).
- This allows the backend server to know which domain the client is requesting and respond accordingly (e.g., by serving the appropriate content for `www.example1.com`).

### **In Summary: How They Work Together**
- **`proxy_ssl_name $host;`** is used to set the **SNI** during the SSL handshake between NGINX and the backend, ensuring that the backend server selects the correct SSL certificate for the requested domain (based on the value of `$host`).
  
- **`proxy_set_header Host $host;`** ensures that the **HTTP `Host` header** in the forwarded request matches the original `Host` header sent by the client, allowing the backend to properly route the request to the correct virtual host or domain-based configuration.

### **Example of Full Flow with Both Directives**

Assume the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name www.example1.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://backend.example.com;
        proxy_ssl_name $host;  # Use $host as the SNI for SSL/TLS handshake
        proxy_set_header Host $host;  # Pass the Host header to the backend
    }
}
```

1. **Client Request**: A client makes an HTTPS request to `https://www.example1.com`.

2. **NGINX Configuration**:
   - **SNI**: NGINX sends `www.example1.com` as the SNI during the SSL/TLS handshake to `backend.example.com`, so that the backend can use the correct certificate.
   - **Host Header**: NGINX forwards the `Host: www.example1.com` header to the backend server, so the backend knows the domain the client is requesting.

3. **Backend Server Behavior**:
   - The backend server receives the request over HTTPS (with the correct certificate for `www.example1.com` thanks to the SNI).
   - The backend processes the HTTP request, aware that the client is requesting `www.example1.com` (based on the `Host` header).

### **When to Use Both in the Same Configuration**
- **When Your Backend Server Uses SNI for SSL/TLS Certificates**: If your backend server hosts multiple domains and uses SNI to serve different SSL certificates for each domain (e.g., `backend.example.com` serving `www.example1.com`, `www.example2.com`, etc.), you'll need to use `proxy_ssl_name $host` to ensure the backend receives the correct SNI for selecting the right SSL certificate.
  
- **When Your Backend Server Needs to See the Correct `Host` Header**: If your backend server uses the `Host` header to determine routing, virtual hosts, or to serve different content based on the domain (for example, serving different websites or applications for each domain), you'll need to use `proxy_set_header Host $host`.

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine a backend server (`backend.example.com`) that serves two different sites: `www.example1.com` and `www.example2.com`. Both sites are served under different SSL certificates using SNI. The following happens:
1. A client connects to `https://www.example1.com`.
2. NGINX proxies the request to `https://backend.example.com` with the SNI set to `www.example1.com` (via `proxy_ssl_name $host`).
3. The backend server uses the correct SSL certificate for `www.example1.com` because of the SNI.
4. The `Host` header (`Host: www.example1.com`) is forwarded to the backend server by `proxy_set_header Host $host;`, ensuring the backend knows that the client is asking for `www.example1.com`.

---

### Conclusion
- **`proxy_ssl_name $host;`** is used to ensure that NGINX sends the correct **SNI** to the backend server during the SSL handshake, allowing the backend to serve the appropriate SSL certificate.
  
- **`proxy_set_header Host $host;`** ensures that the **`Host` header** (which indicates the domain requested by the client) is passed along to the backend server, allowing it to route the request to the appropriate content or virtual host.

When used together, these directives allow NGINX to correctly manage both SSL/TLS negotiation (via SNI) and HTTP request forwarding (via the `Host` header), ensuring the backend serves the correct SSL certificate and responds with the appropriate content for the requested domain.
