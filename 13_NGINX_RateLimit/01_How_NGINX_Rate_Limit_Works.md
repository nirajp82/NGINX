## 🚰 How NGINX Rate Limiting Works – Made Clear

NGINX uses a concept called the **leaky bucket algorithm** to control how many requests a client can send over time. It’s a simple way to **smooth out sudden traffic spikes** and prevent servers from being overwhelmed.

### 🔁 The Leaky Bucket Analogy

Imagine a **bucket** with a small hole at the bottom:

* **Water is poured in** → This represents **incoming requests** from users.
* **Water leaks out slowly** from the bottom → This represents requests being **processed by the server** at a fixed, controlled rate.
* If **too much water comes in at once**, the bucket **overflows** → This means **extra requests are dropped** because the system can’t handle them all at once.

### 🧠 How This Translates to NGINX

| Analogy        | In NGINX Terms                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Water          | Client requests                            |
| Bucket         | Request queue (FIFO)                       |
| Hole in bucket | Fixed rate at which requests are processed |
| Overflow       | Requests that are **rejected or dropped**  |

NGINX adds requests to a queue (the "bucket") and processes them **one by one** at a fixed rate. If too many requests come in **faster than they can be processed**, and the queue is full, NGINX **drops** the extra requests to protect the server.

This helps ensure that traffic is handled **steadily**, even if there are sudden spikes or bursts.

### 🔎 Key Points

* Requests are **queued** if they arrive too fast.
* NGINX **processes requests at a steady rate** (like water leaking from a bucket).
* If the queue (bucket) is **full**, new requests are **rejected**.
* This behavior is managed by rate-limiting settings like `limit_req`, `burst`, and `nodelay`.
