# Directive

## `user` Directive:
The `user` directive specifies the user and group under which the Nginx worker processes will run. This directive determines the user privileges for handling incoming requests and serving files. It's important to set appropriate user and group values to enhance security and limit the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.

`user nginx;`

## `worker_processes` Directive:
The `worker_processes` directive sets the number of worker processes that Nginx will spawn to handle incoming connections and process requests. Nginx uses an event-driven architecture, and each worker process operates independently, handling multiple connections simultaneously. The value you set for worker_processes depends on your server's hardware and workload.

`worker_processes 4;`
`worker_processes auto;`

## error_log Directive:
The error_log directive specifies the file where Nginx should write error log messages. It helps administrators diagnose issues and monitor the server's health. You can set the log level to control the verbosity of the log entries. Common log levels include debug, info, notice, warn, and error.

`error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;`

## pid Directive:
The pid directive defines the path to the file where Nginx will write the process ID (PID) of the master process. This PID file is useful for various administrative tasks, such as monitoring, starting, stopping, and restarting Nginx processes.

`pid /var/run/nginx.pid;`
