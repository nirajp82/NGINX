## 1. Introduction to Load Balancing

Load balancing is a technique that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization, improved performance, and high availability. Nginx, a versatile web server and reverse proxy, also offers robust load balancing capabilities.

## 2. Load Balancing Methods

### Round Robin

**Description:** Requests are sequentially assigned to each backend server, distributing the load evenly.

### Least Connections

**Description:** Requests are directed to the server with the fewest active connections, optimizing resource utilization.

### IP Hash

**Description:** Requests from the same IP address are consistently routed to the same backend server, maintaining session affinity.

### Generic Hash

**Description:** Allows customized hashing based on variables, enabling fine-grained control over load distribution.

## 3. Configuring Load Balancing in Nginx

### Upstream Block

The `upstream` block defines a group of backend servers and the load balancing algorithm to be used.

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        # Load balancing method (e.g., round-robin)
        round-robin;

        # Server definitions
        server backend1.example.com weight=5 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
        server backend2.example.com weight=3 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Load Balancing Algorithms Parameters

- **weight:** Assigns a weight to each server, influencing the distribution of requests.
- **max_fails:** Sets the maximum number of consecutive failures allowed before considering a server as unhealthy.
- **fail_timeout:** Defines the time during which failures are counted.

## 4. Health Checks

### Active Health Checks (Nginx Plus)

_Active health checks are a feature of Nginx Plus, the commercial version._

Nginx periodically sends requests to backend servers to assess their health. Unhealthy servers are temporarily removed based on failure thresholds and timeouts.

### Passive Health Checks

Passive health checks rely on external monitoring systems to report server health. Nginx reacts to these reports, redirecting traffic away from unhealthy servers.

## 5. Configuration Examples

### Active Health Checks (Nginx Plus)

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        least_conn;

        # Active health check settings
        health_check interval=5s fails=2 passes=3 uri=/health;

        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```

### Passive Health Checks

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        least_conn;

        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            error_page 502 = @fallback;
        }

        location @fallback {
            # Handle case when all backend servers are down
        }
    }
}
```
