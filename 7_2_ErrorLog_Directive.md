# Nginx Error Log Levels

Nginx provides the flexibility to configure different error log levels, allowing you to control the level of detail in your error logs. Understanding these log levels and how to use them effectively is essential for monitoring server health, diagnosing issues, and troubleshooting problems.

## 1. Introduction to Error Log Levels

Nginx offers several error log levels, each serving a specific purpose:

- **debug**: The most verbose level, ideal for detailed debugging during development or troubleshooting.

- **info**: Provides general information about server operations, suitable for routine monitoring.

- **notice**: Logs noteworthy events that may affect performance or server behavior without indicating errors.

- **warn**: Logs warnings about potential issues that should be addressed to prevent future problems.

- **error**: Logs errors that affect server functionality, critical for issue identification.

- **crit**: Logs critical errors with a severe impact on server operation, requiring immediate attention.

- **alert**: Logs critical conditions demanding immediate intervention to prevent server failure.

- **emerg**: The highest level, reserved for emergency situations rendering the server unusable.

## 2. Configuring Different Log Levels

You can configure different error log levels in Nginx using the `error_log` directive. Here's an example:

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;
        
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/debug.log debug;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/info.log info;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/notice.log notice;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/warn.log warn;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log error;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/crit.log crit;
        
        ...
    }
}
```

In this example, messages of different log levels are directed to separate log files for better organization and control.

## 3. Choosing the Right Log Level

Choosing the appropriate log level depends on your monitoring and diagnostic needs. In production environments, it's common to use "error" and "crit" levels for routine monitoring and issue identification, reserving lower levels for specific diagnostics or troubleshooting phases.

## 4. Log Rotation

Implement log rotation mechanisms to manage log file sizes and prevent them from consuming excessive disk space. Use a tool like `logrotate` to automate this process. Example `logrotate` configuration is provided earlier in this document.

## 5. Important Considerations

- Be mindful of the log levels you configure, especially verbose levels like "debug." Use them sparing
