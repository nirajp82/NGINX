# Nginx Configuration Contexts

Nginx is a high performance web server that is responsible for handling the load of some of the largest sites on the internet. It is especially good at handling many concurrent connections and excels at forwarding or serving static content. 

 The location of Nginx configuration file will depend on how Nginx was installed. On many Linux distributions, the file will be located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. If it does not exist there, it may also be at `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` or `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
